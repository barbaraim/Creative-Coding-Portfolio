# Creative Coding Portfolio ðŸŽ¨

This repository is a portafolio of CMPM169 Creative Coding, taken in UCSC Winter 2022. 

Each week represents a different theme, culminating in a final project. All of the art is created with p5.js. 

The portafolio can be seen in ```https://barbaraim.github.io/Creative-Coding-Portfolio/```.
